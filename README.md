# msdk-template
You can use this skeleton code to get started on your game simulations. This uses several library functions available in the git repo located at  [msdk-lib](https://github.com/shayerwaseemshaikk/msdk-lib.git).

To get started, suppose your new game is **N218**, 
1. Create a new Folder in your laptop and name it **N218** at your convenient location.
2. Create two new folders inside **N218**, one is **Game**, and the other is **UtilLibrary** 

First you need to clone the library functions that will be used by your game code. To do that,

//copy first and then open visual studio
1. Copy this web url https://github.com/shayerwaseemshaikk/msdk-lib.git to be cloned into your local. 
2. Open visual studio, and click **Clone a repository** option. Paste the copied URL into the repository location.
3. You need to select the **Path** as the **UtilLibrary** folder you created previously
4. Click on **Clone**. This will clone the entire  [msdk-lib](https://github.com/shayerwaseemshaikk/msdk-lib.git) to your laptop.
5. Close visual studio

Next, you need to use this repo template to create your own game repo for **N218**.

1. Open [msdk-template](https://github.com/shayerwaseemshaikk/msdk-template) and click **Use this template** green button on this repo's code page and select **Create a new repository**
2. Select the owner as you, and name the repository as **game-simulation-n218**
3. Select private for accessibility restriction
4. Click **Create repository from template** . This will create a new repo in github for **N218** game which you can use it as a starting point for your simulations.
5. Open visual studio, and click **Clone a repository** option.
6. Paste the web URL for the newly created repository. You will find it when you click **Code** button and copy the available link in the repo page in github.
7.  You need to select the **Path** as the **Game** folder you created initially
8.  Click on **Clone**. This will clone the entire skeleton game code to your laptop

Now your code is set up and you can start adding game logic. The starting point of the code is ```Program.cs``` available in **Game** folder.
